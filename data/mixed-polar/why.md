The target is the balanced monomial
\[
A=X_0\cdot X_1\cdot X_2\cdot Y_0\cdot Y_1\cdot Y_2,
\]
on a deformation of the holdout with chain coefficients \(1/2\) and an additional term \(\tfrac13\cdot X_0\cdot X_1\cdot Y_0\cdot Y_1^3\). That term has bidegree \((2,4)\), whereas the chain terms have bidegree \((4,2)\). The paired sign changes preserve both equation and target.

Compare the identical target on [the all-six holdout instance](#case/holdout-all-six). Its cover construction uses \(T^6=Y_0^6+Y_2^6\), \(y=Y_1\), and the exchange \(y\leftrightarrow T\). In the present equation the extra coupling becomes
\[
\frac13\cdot\alpha\cdot X_0\cdot X_1\cdot y^3\cdot T,
\qquad \alpha=Y_0/T.
\]
It lacks the exchanged term proportional to \(y\cdot T^3\). Consequently the equation does not descend to the same weighted quotient, even though the balanced target has exactly the trace character used successfully on the holdout. A favorable target projection cannot compensate for the loss of the quotient geometry on which its primitive is constructed.

The complementary quotient of [Chapter 2, §2.8](#technical-information/explicit-constructions) has a different failure here. Its diagonal action with weights \((5,1,5)\) on \(Y\) gives the extra coupling weight two. Consequently the polynomial-density integration theorem on that quotient cannot be imported without first constructing a replacement quotient.

The common factor \(X_0\cdot X_1\cdot Y_0\cdot Y_1\) in the first coupling and the added term still leaves useful structure. It suggests investigating adapted quadratic coordinates or a replacement cover, with the asymmetric combination of \(X_0^2\) and \(Y_1^2\) kept explicit. A successful construction must control both the equation and the density; matching the target's pairwise balance alone is insufficient.

The paired-sign substitution \(Y_i=r_iX_i\), \(u_i=X_i^2\) makes another boundary explicit. The added coupling becomes \(\frac13r_0r_1^3u_0u_1^2\), reversing the first cubic edge. The [cyclic cubic construction](#case/cycle-three) shows that a Jacobian and a moving-map correction can replace the lost chain quotient, but its six-coefficient cyclic cubic and polynomial-curve incidence are not this model. Here both the altered Jacobian family and the balanced physical source need a derivative-compatible transport. The shared moving-map identity addresses a correction term once such data are supplied; it does not furnish the missing primitive.
